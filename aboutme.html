												<h3>A Little About My Work</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												Over the course of my career, I've been fortunate to gain hands-on experience with a diverse range of lighting consoles, including the ETC Ion and ETC Element 2. My expertise extends beyond consoles, as I've primarily worked with cutting-edge LED fixtures, while also cultivating proficiency with traditional incandescent fixtures. This well-rounded exposure has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of both DMX-based control systems and conventional stage adressing, enabling me to seamlessly adapt to various technological setups and deliver exceptional lighting designs for a wide array of theatrical productions.</p>

												<h3>Spanning Outside Of The Theater</h3>
											</header>
											<p>In my view, the world of theatre is a truly exceptional and distinct field. Not only does it afford opportunities to collaborate with talented professionals, but it also fosters a sense of camaraderie among the theater community, leading to strong bonds with colleagues who become like a second family. The relationships forged in this dynamic environment often extend beyond the theater walls, creating friendships that thrive both during and outside of productions, making the social aspect of this profession truly unparalleled and immensely rewarding.</p>

										<h2>My Story</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Hello! I'm Logan Godfrey, a lighting designer based in Minnesota and currently attending the University of Wisconsin Stevens Point, where I'm majoring in Theatre Design and Technology. My journey in the world of theater began in middle school when I got the chance to act in our school's musical. After that first show, I was completely hooked and believed acting was my calling. However, fate had different plans, and a forgetful audition led me to join the tech team instead. Surprisingly, I found myself enjoying the behind-the-scenes work, and from that point on, I chose tech over auditions.

										Fast forward to high school, where everything changed yet again with new classmates, classes, and shows now taking place on a real stage. Just when things seemed to be going smoothly, the pandemic hit, and we were all confined to our homes, uncertain of the future. In the midst of this challenging time, I relocated from Texas to Minnesota, trying to adapt to a new environment while navigating the pandemic's uncertainties. Throughout it all, I found solace in the theater, which kept going despite the challenges. The people I met during this period became my second family, drawing me deeper into the world of theater and making me fall in love with it even more.
										
										Reflecting on the past three eventful years, I am truly grateful for every opportunity I've been given, and I owe it all to my directors, my family, and, most importantly, my friends who have been with me through thick and thin. They've been my pillars of support, and I can't thank them enough. Here's to the incredible journey that theater has taken me on, and I'm excited for all the new experiences and adventures that lie ahead! Thank you.</p>
